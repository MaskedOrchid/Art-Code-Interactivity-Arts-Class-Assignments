Assignments in this section were all written in the P5 framework online editor to. Below I provided links to assignments in the editor for live previews.
The goal of these assignments were to create particle systems, basic physics behavoirs, and movement. We learned how to use vectors, noise, flow charts, 
and math to create these systems.
